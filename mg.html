                    bought by China based SAIC Motor Corporation in 2008. MG Motors made its debut in India with the
                    inauguration of its first facility in India located in Halol, Gujarat. The corporate office of the
                    brand in India is located in Gurugram, Haryana.<a href="javascript:void(0);" id="more">View more</a>

                <span id="show-hide">
                    <p>The first product for MG in India is the Hector. The company launched the Hector as a mid-size
                        SUV.
                        The Hector is based on SAIC Motor’s Baojun 530. The Hector was launched in India with prices
                        starting at Rs 12.18 lakhs for the base trim and Rs 16.88 lakhs for the top-end trim (all
                        prices,
                        ex-showroom). The model is available with 3 engine options including a 1.5-litre petrol motor,
                        1.5-litre petrol-hybrid motor, and a 2.0-litre diesel motor.

                    <p>
                        MG promoted the Hector by promoting British actor Benedict Cumberbatch as the brand ambassador.
                        The
                        company is now preparing to launch its second product in India, the eZS. The MG eZS is an
                        all-electric vehicle. The model will be produced at the company’s plant in Gujarat. This
                        facility
                        can currently produce 80,000-1 lakh units a year. If expanded, the production can be increased
                        to 2
                        lakh units a year.<a href="javascript:void(0);" id="less">View less</a>
